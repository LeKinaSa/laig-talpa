## Project information

- Beautiful Animations for Moving and Removing Pieces
- Scene
  - The first scene is a living room. There we can find the game on a table, with a chair for each player.
    There are also sofas, a fireplace, plants and lamps.
  - The second scene is a lake. There we can find the game on a canoe, with a seat for each player.
    The paddles of the canoe move in the water, and there are some fishes passing by.
