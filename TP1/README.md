## Issues/Problems

- In this project, we managed to complete every single requirement while only having 2 main issues.
- The first problem was when configuring the cameras. This placement required some adjustments, and it required us to analyze its positioning to try to improve it. However, most of the time, the camera wouldn't show anything or wouldn't be enough to reposition the camera properly.
- The second problem was when calculating the texture coordinates for the triangle. We know that there is an explanation with an example in moodle. However, it only applied in the case where our triangle was able to fit in a 1 x 1 square. So we had to adapt this example to the case when the triangle could be of any size since that's the case with our triangle.
- In the end, we were able to surpass all the problems and obtain our scene completely parsed and represented.
